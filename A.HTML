<center> The way things are right now isnt the way way that they will be forever. If you feel stuck, believe it is possible to feel diffirently. believing in posibility is one way of having hope, there is a lot of experience in this lifetime in your deepest struggle lies your great strength and also that struggle will become your wisdom, always be possitive in life no matter how many times you fall,you must be determined to stand back up again and to be determined to succeed in life,without hope,you have no purpose, rise up and just try again and again and again you must not lose hope. When you stop dreaming your life ends,when you stop believing your hope ends, dream and hope inorder for you to continue and move forward in life no one said that life is easy, there are many challenges and problem everyday like this pandemic, and this pandemic change our lives and it really affect others it challenge us, and that challenges and problems are what God gave to you because he trust and believe in you that you can do it and also in that way he wants you to become a better version of yourself to make you even better and to make you realize. There are times when life troubles are not meant to be solved. In other words, you need to move with your life no matter how heavy the situation is, as long as you have hope, you will overcome the difficulties just don't give up and always know your worth. I choose dove because, dove is also one of the symbols of hope, Christianity use this and it is inspired to Jesus, so I think that the dove represents Jesus that he is our hope, that he is the one who can save us in this times, and the hand desgin represents us, that we need to follow God that we need to follow his plans for us because his plans is way more better than ours, and also that we need to trust in him and to always never lose faith.</.center>
